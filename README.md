The PythonBo's Github repository. For more info visit http://dev.bomilanovich.com

I will share the code I use in my tutorials here. You can obviously download them for free. I also welcome pull requests with code modifications.

Please visit my YouTube channel for all videos: http://youtube.com/Deusdies2 (somewhat outdated)

A more professionally-done, up-to-date video tutorials are available at http://www.udemy.com/python-gui-programming

The newest one, and the best one (by far) can be found on Pluralsight - http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/Discussion/python-desktop-application-development
